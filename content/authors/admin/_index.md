I am interested in leveraging computational methods and high-performance computing infrastructure to provide insight into complex problems including the elucidation of protein-protein interactions and binding interfaces, analysis of autonomous vehicle-sensed data, scientometrics, and the promotion of access to information. 

My thesis is focused on the development of a novel semi-supervised machine learning method, however as a polymath and solutionist, I am involved in a diverse array of research projects. I am passionate about scientific communication and am currently an executive editor of the Health Science Inquiry.
